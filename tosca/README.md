## Images
There are several options on how to indicate the image to be use on the TOSCA template, however this one is the recommended:

``appdb://<site_name>/<apc_name>?<vo_name>``, for FedCloud OCCI or OpenStack connector using AppDB info (from vers. 1.6.0 and 1.8.6).

**To work, the images should be available at [appdb.egi.eu](https://appdb.egi.eu/).**
